# Softwaretechnology In Cyber-Physical systems *Workshop 1*
This project is from the course *"Softwaretechnology In Cyber-Physical Systems"* at SDU, where the task was to create a hazelcast
client to communicate with other student's own implementation of a hazelcast client.

This was to illustrate and gain experience in the *Publish/Subscribe* software design pattern, as well as asynchronous information
sharing and integration difficulties. E.g. this implementation uses JSON objects to send data to each other subscribed client, of
which a common design (or common members) were discussed with each group.
